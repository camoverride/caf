      <h1>Keep White Supremacy Out of Seattle!</h1>
      <p>The Conru Art Foundation (CAF) is Andrew Conru's attempt to gain influence in the Seattle Art community. Conru is a white supremacist and supporter of eugenics. Don't just take our word for it, <a style="color: #a67833" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/16/revealed-international-race-science-network-secretly-funded-by-us-tech-boss">read the Guardian Article!</a></p>

      <p>As an artist or art appreciator, you have the power to choose which venues you visit or work with. Make an informed decision!</p>

        <h2>Conru Gave $1 Million to a Eugenics Group</h2>
                <img src="genetics.jpg" alt="picture of genes">
        <p>This wasn't an accident or oversight. Conru made a secret $1 million donation to the so-called "Human Diversity Foundation" (HDF), a group that promotes eugenics. He did it personally, outside of his charitable organization. That's not an accident, it's intent.</p>

        <h2>A non-apology isn't enough</h2>
        <img src="conru.jpg" alt="picture of Andrew Conru">
        <p><a href="https://conru.com/open_letter.html"> Conru's apology</a> leans on the tired "free speech" excuse to justify donations to hate groups. But supporting a platform for white supremacy isn't neutral--it legitimizes these ideas. Conru claims that the HDF "deviated from its goals," but it was a hate group from the start. If he believes eugenics deserves a hearing, he's already made a moral choice.</p>

        <h2>The Profile of a Techno-Fascist</h2>
                <img src="hegseth.jpg" alt="A Techno-Fascist">
        <p>Like Peter Thiel, Elon Musk, and other tech fascists, Andrew Conru spreads his donations across the political spectrum. But when <a style="color: #a67833" href="https://www.instrumentl.com/990-report/conru-foundation">nearly 20% of all his charitable donations are going towards eugenics</a>, the message is clear.</p>
